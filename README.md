# Project 2 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: **Suldana Abdulkadir Afrah**

**Wordle** is an app that allows you to type letters in order to guess a word that you don't know yet based on hints about whether the letter you wrote is in the word, or if it's in the right position in the word you guessed.

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [X] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [X] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [X] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes
One challenged I faced was when to use guard let for let if. However, I quickly overcame it and mostly used let if for most of the project. Other than that and trying to understand the functionality of certain things used in the code like "#selector" I would say I didn't have any major challenges in implementing this project.
